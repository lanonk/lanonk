My name is Nolan Chigede. I majored in Economics and double minored in Mathematics and Data Science. I love analyzing data and implementing statistical inferences.My main approach is not only identify correlation or best algorithms, but to investigate causality. I enjoy further research to understand the features and organization of the datasets I analyze.
